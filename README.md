# Asset-Allocation
## A gentle introduction to asset allocation for beginners.

## Project Goal
The objective of this repo is dual and follows the principle that writing is an exercise for both the writer and the reader. I've come to the realization that I've accumulated a significant amount of notions but haven't spent enough time reasoning through what I've learned so far. This project should help me close that gap, as well as help the reader grasp the basic notions to gain a fundamental understanding of the world of investing. I will add resources for each topic so that the reader can increase his or her understanding, as I'm aware of how limited my knowledge is.

*Please question what You read: I can make mistakes and I’m always open to learning and improving.*
